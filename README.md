Sportshack Supplement Depot - https://sportshack-client.vercel.app/ (will be changed to www.sportshacksupplementdepot.com) - A website designed for a business in Lafayette, LA.

Why? The original site was cluttered, dated, and not user-friendly. As a friend of the owner, I offered to redesign the site so that people can see what he offers. I made sure to feature his most popular products, smoothies, cafe, and training accessories.

On the landing page, a simple introduction explains what the business does and who it serves. From there, each menu item will take the user to a featured part of the store. The goal is to drive as many people to visit the store in person so the full experience can be had.

I'm using a self-built server/API to store the nutrition facts for every smoothie. 2 tables are used... 1 for each smoothie size offered.
